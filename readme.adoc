= Docker - Spring Actuator

This is a simple POC for:

* docker
* docker-compose
* spring actuator

== Install and run

* Download the source file from GITHUB: git clone https://github.com/bindstone/docker-actuator.git

* Build it with: mvn clean install

* Run it with: docker-compose --build up

== Testing approaches

docker-actuator-server

INSIDE BUILD: In this approach the base image is [maven:3.6-jdk-8-alpine]. It contains next to the JDK
also the Maven tools. During the process to build the image, Docker will copy source in the image, download
all Maven dependencies in the image repository, build the artifacts and start the server.

The image itself is bigger in size, as the dependency objects are multiple time in the image present:
* maven repository,
* maven build jar,
* maven build jar with tomcat
* ...

docker-actuator-client

OUTSIDE BUILD: In this approach the base image is [openjdk:8-jdk-alpine]. During the process to build the
image, only the artifact docker-actuator-client.jar will be copied in the image. This requires a preprocess
by the developer or building tools like Jenkins to execute the maven build outside.

== Results

When starting the docker-compose you should access to the different server and clients.

Rest request:

* Server:  http://127.0.0.1:8888/hello[]
* Client1: http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello[]
* Client2: http://127.0.0.1:8081/hello[]

Also accessing to Actuator: http://127.0.0.1:8888/#/wallboard[]

Shows you two running services, and the client has currently 2 running instances:
